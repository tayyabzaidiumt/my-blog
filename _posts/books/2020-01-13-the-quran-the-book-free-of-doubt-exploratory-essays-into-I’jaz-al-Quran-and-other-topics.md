It has become increasingly rare for Pakistani scholars to engage in a serious discussion outside their disciplinary walls.  The likes of  Muhammad Hasan Askari and Karrar Hussain (who were both professors of English but regularly roved outside the literary precincts)  belonged to another age in which scholarly breadth was often read as a sign of intellectual robustness. Now, despite the advantages of technology, few academics venture to write on topics beyond their ever shrinking pale of specialization. Even including specialist works that Pakistani English professors have put out over the last one year might leave several fingers to spare.

In this dry-ink atmosphere, Syed Munir Wasti’s  assortment of ‘exploratory essays into Ijaz al-Quran and other topics’ published under the title The Quran: the Book Free of Doubt by the University of Gujrat Press comes as a welcome surprise . Professor Wasti who currently chairs the Department of English, University of Karachi has re-charged the memory of illustrious Pakistani men of letters whose voice was frequently heard outside their own professional corridors. However on a more personal note the choice of the subject of the book is hardly surprising for the author. A third-generation English professor, Dr Wasti has chosen a subject that would surely bring comfort to his forbears in their graves. Both his father and his grandfather were dedicated scholars of English literary studies. Interestingly both of them wrote extensively on Islamic subjects. Professor Syed Abdul Ghani, the author’s grandfather, had rendered Sheikh Sa’adi Shirazi’s Karima into English while our author’s father Professor Syed Jamiluddin Wasti  had delved into the challenges posed by modernity for practicing Muslim communities in his book Islami Riwayaat . It is therefore not all that inexplicable that Professor Munir Wasti should have published the volume under consideration. An intellectual taste for Islamic studies flows in his blood.

Divided into four sections titled respectively the ‘Quran text’, ‘grammar’, ‘Ijaz al-Quran’ and ‘general’, this relatively short work contains almost a hundred chapters of varying length.  The book is replete with references to Urdu, English and Arabic works, classical as well as modern. The writer showcases an impressive range of accomplished scholars alongside some not-so-accomplished aspirants throughout the book which amply reflects his wide reading.  For anyone wishing to acquaint himself with some of the central issues in the history of Quranic studies, Exploratory Essays should serve as a good primer. The short essays compiled here are obviously disparate pieces; hence there is no overarching thesis to bind them.  The busy reader may pick the book from anywhere and take in as much as he or she can before being diverted by mundane demands. This sort of  pointed self-containment that characterizes all the pieces may appeal to those suffering from ‘interruptitus’ i.e. continual distractions but for someone looking for a singular thesis across the chapters, the bite-sized treatment of the topic occasionally undercuts the inner momentum of the book. The snippets such as the ‘Names of surahs’, ‘Mushkilat al Quran’ and ‘The use of the mutlaq and the muqayyad’  touch on  crucial topics but each of them is wrapped up in half a page leaving the reader thirsting for an expanded treatment. For some reason, on most occasions the writer stops short of developing a sustained argument. If there is any progression in the book, it is loosely thematic and internal to each section.

Then there are pieces that have an encyclopedic usefulness. The two separate write-ups on the flora and fauna cited in the Quran list the animals and plants mentioned in the Book. There are actually several entries of this kind such as the one on the variant ‘readings’ (recitation styles) of the Quran, and on the Huruf al-shamsiyya wa al-qamariyya (Sun- and moon-letters) of the Arabic alphabet.

One of those infrequent occasions when Prof. Wasti deals with a topic at some length occurs in an informative essay on the ‘Aspects of Quran translation’. He grapples with the purported objections to Quranic translation and examines the historical causes for the beliefs surrounding the untranslatability of revelation.

A piquant series of essays that should rather have been worked into a consolidated treatise addresses the issue of textual corruption (tahrif). Wasti squarely rebuts the marginal voices that have from time to time doubted the inviolability of the Quran. It would have lent further value to the essay had the researcher documented how the Orientalists sometimes sourced their opinions to fringe Muslim voices.

Another noteworthy essay is the early piece on the history of the Quranic text which presents the critical milestones in the compilation of the sacred scripture. This is a promising starter and it also serves as a preview to the rest of the book.  The narrative builds up steadily but then the essay takes a sudden, descriptive turn. The details are doubtless integral to the history of the Book but their inclusion here seems to have a halting effect on the flow of the essay.

The book contains many semi-biographical book reviews particularly in the section on ‘I’jaz al-Quran’. These are biographical to the extent that they profile the contributors to Quranic studies in terms of their scholarly background and religious orientation. The astonishing diversity of these scholars ranging from classical authorities such as al-Baqillani, al-Qurtabi and Shah Waliullah to Muslim modernists such as Ismail R. Faruqi and Mohammed Arkoun and orientalists such as Arthur Jeffery and John Wansbrough evokes mixed feelings. Prof. Wasti is fond of reserving an independent point of view on most topics and feels no qualms in throwing down the gauntlet at scholarly deliberations.

The book closes with a detailed bibliography that students and scholars of comparative Quranic studies will surely find helpful. The works consulted or cited by the author are arranged under separate thematic and linguistic heads.  An index of proper names is also included.

Despite the glitches, the book merits attention for engaging a range of questions surrounding Quranic textual studies. As a conversation-starter, Wasti’s book is bound to spark some heat on a number of controversial topics it touches.  The University of Gujrat Press has gone an extra mile in embellishing the physical layout of the book. Its attractive title, the creamy art paper and a round- spine binding make it an attractive feast for the book collector.
