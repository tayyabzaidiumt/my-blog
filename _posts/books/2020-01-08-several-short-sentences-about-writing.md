**Start with a catchy attention-grabbing opening**  
Charmed by its title, I remember the exact moment I picked up Several Short Sentences About Writing (SSSaW) for the first time. I was in the Madison Public Library on South Park Street in Madison, Wisconsin. The year was 2013, a little after the book had arrived at the library. I flipped through its pages and was intrigued by two things: one, the commanding tone; and two, the almost verse-like arrangement of its paragraphs. I went back to the Short Sentences title; and then dipped again inside the book which only had but short sentences. It was just too irresistibly idiosyncratic to borrow. I put the book back on the library rack and ordered a personal copy on Amazon.

**Present the central idea or topic of the book**  
SSSaW belongs to the genre of academic or professional self-help books. It is a collection of expert advice to improve one's prose. What makes the book unique is that it practises what it preaches. It is written exactly in the style of writing it advocates. The ideas presented here are in the form of aphorisms or concise and simple statements full of wisdom.

**Present the first feature you want to discuss**  
The essential charm of SSSaW is in the natural, poetic voice which commands the subject of the book. As an editor of one of the world's top English newspapers, The New York Times, Klinkenborg's writerly confidence and creative elegance are reflected in the opinions he expresses. Here for instance is what he advises on crafting the beginning of an essay or article:

You want to begin the piece, not introduce it, which is the difference between a first sentence already moving at speed and a first sentence that wants to generalize while clearing its throat.


**Present the second feature you want to discuss**  
Read in its entirety, the book is remarkably comprehensive in the scope of prescriptions it offers. These include suggestions on analyzing the target readers, balancing explanatory points with concrete evidence, controlling the tone and rhythm of writing, creating cohesion and coherence, and above all mastering the sentence.


**Present the third feature you want to discuss**  
In structure, the book is one whole piece. No chapters. How the content is organized is not at once clear but the various aspects of writing are discussed coherently. The progression from topic to topic is natural- not forced or arbitrary. For instance, the book opens with the sentences arranged precisely as below:

*Here, in short, is what I want to tell you.  
Know what each sentence says,  
What it doesnâ€™t say,  
And what it implies.  
Of these, the hardest is knowing what each sentence actually says.*  

After that, within the first few pages consisting of short paragraphs, Klinkenborg transitions over a lot of different topics. He brings up the importance of rhythm, the anathema of cliches and the uselessness of school advice. He reiterates the mightiness of short sentences. On the first reading, these pages feel like lossely arranged, topically organized maxims and quotes. However Klinkenborg corrects this impression quickly. It soon emerges that all the preceding points were actually in service of the initial advice ('As a writer, knowing what each sentence says and implies is difficult but crucial'). And the apparently casual shift in topics was perfectly in keeping with the colloquial tenor of the book.


**Present the limitations of the book and your overall personal opinion**  
I have read many books on the art of writing. SSSaW is unusual in its class. What makes it appealing for me is not mainly the novelty of its ideas. Klinkenborg's recommendations should be fairly familiar to anyone who has read a book or two on writing skills. In fact, many readers have found the advice offered in SSSaW too well-known.  There is hardly anything revelatory about urging the importance of knowing the readers, or counseling that the writer should avoid using cliches like a plague, or that he or she should take revision seriously.

I like SSSaW firstly because it is written in a style that is at once poetic and conversational. Instead of moving like an instructional (do's and don'ts) textbook- slow, heavy and abstract- Klinkenborg's work flows like poetry, full of striking metaphors and suggestive understatements. Even so, the tone of the writer remains quite friendly and down-to-earth. I also love the book because as I said earlier the SSSaW 'guide', if one could call it so, is astonishingly comprehensive in the range of topics it addresses within its covers.
